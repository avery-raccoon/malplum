# malplum
Malplum is a poisoned JSON API that serves synthetic user data to spambot crawlers. Every request returns randomized, plausible nonsenseâ€”emails, tokens, preferences, and more. Designed for public exposure, Malplum pollutes data harvesting operations with sweet-looking, structured garbage.

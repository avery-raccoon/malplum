# malplum
Malplum is a poisoned JSON API that serves synthetic user data to spambot crawlers. Every request returns randomized, plausible nonsenseâ€”emails, tokens, preferences, and more. Designed for public exposure, Malplum pollutes data harvesting operations with sweet-looking, structured garbage. Feed them garbage, with the help of Malplum! Every request serves plausible, randomized user dataâ€”emails, tokens, fake names, preferences, and moreâ€”all completely synthetic and deliciously useless.

The name *Malplum* is a constructed Latinism: **malus** (bad, evil) + **prunum** (plum), a nod to *bad fruit* and *bad luck*. It draws direct inspiration from [Devin Carraway's Sugarplum project(https://devin.com/sugarplum/), expanding the concept with dynamic content and a whimsical mean streak.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

Malplum is a single PHP endpoint that:
- Generates fake email addresses, names, tokens, and metadata
- Randomly includes extra fields like `location`, `interests`, or `signup_source`
- Varies output slightly with each request to mimic real user data
- Returns well-formed JSON every time, perfect for bot ingestion

The result: structured, convincing, and **absolutely worthless** data, seeded into the wild to poison unethical data harvesters.

Futre versions / aspirational goals include:
  - Generate massive amounts of data to dilute any real information scraped
  - Vary the data quality - mix some "premium looking" records with obvious junk
  - Include different confidence levels of fake data to waste analysis time
  - Include data types that specific bot categories find valuable (email lists, user credentials, financial info)
  - Add metadata that suggests this is "internal" or "premium" data
  - Use realistic-looking API endpoints or database dump formats
  - Serving different datasets to different IP ranges
  - Vary the response time and data structure randomly
  - Include some "real looking" patterns mixed with nonsense
  - Add realistic error rates and edge cases in the data
  - Canary tokens to show the who & what (& when)

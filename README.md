# malplum
Malplum is a poisoned JSON API that serves synthetic user data to spambot crawlers. Every request returns randomized, plausible nonsense‚Äîemails, tokens, preferences, and more. Designed for public exposure, Malplum pollutes data harvesting operations with sweet-looking, structured garbage. Feed them garbage, with the help of Malplum!

**Malplum** is a poisoned JSON API designed to pollute the data streams of spambots and web scrapers. Every request serves plausible, randomized user data‚Äîemails, tokens, fake names, preferences, and more‚Äîall completely synthetic and deliciously useless.

The name *Malplum* is a constructed Latinism: **malus** (bad, evil) + **prunum** (plum), a nod to *bad fruit* and *bad luck*. It draws direct inspiration from [Devin Carraway's Sugarplum project](https://github.com/dcaraway/sugarplum), expanding the concept with dynamic content and a whimsical mean streak.

## üîß How It Works

Malplum is a single PHP endpoint that:
- Generates fake email addresses, names, tokens, and metadata
- Randomly includes extra fields like `location`, `interests`, or `signup_source`
- Varies output slightly with each request to mimic real user data
- Returns well-formed JSON every time, perfect for bot ingestion

The result: structured, convincing, and **absolutely worthless** data, seeded into the wild to poison unethical data harvesters.
